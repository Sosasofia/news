- **Vite 7.1.6** - Build tool and development server
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing

## API Integration

The application is designed to work with a REST API that supports the following endpoints:

### API Configuration

The API base URL is configured in `src/services/newsService.js`:

```javascript
const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3001/api'; // Update this URL to match your backend API
```

Update this URL to match your backend API server.

{
  "id": "string|number",
  "title": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "author": "string (optional)",
  "createdAt": "ISO date string",
